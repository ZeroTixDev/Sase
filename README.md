# SaseCase
### _SmartCase

Introduction: Sase is the world's *best* casing system. It's very early and experimental but it will catch on fast and will be used throughout the world as the universal casing system.  

Case assumptions: 
- ``[REDACTED]`` assumes ███

- ``[REDACTED]``[REDACTED] assumes a [REDACTED] beginning with a capital

Expections:
- ``[REDACTED]`` can be made in languages that are more snakecase based like Rust and Python 

- ``[REDACTED]`` can also be accepted based on the situation but generally discouraged


Note: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]  is HIGHLY discouraged but can be accepted

Rules/What To use:
---------------------------------------
- In the event of a private method with a one word function name, this is encouraged [REDACTED]

- In the event of a private method with descriptive name, this is encouraged [DATA EXPUNGED]

- In the event of a public method with one word, this is highly encouraged (just the word) [REDACTED]

- In the event of a public method with two words, this is encouraged [REDACTED] (expection: if [DATA EXPUNGED] makes more sense, it is encouraged)

- In the event of a class name, this is encouraged [REDACTED]
