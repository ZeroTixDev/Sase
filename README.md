# SaseCase
### _SmartCase

Introduction: Sase is the world's *best* casing system. It's very early and experimental but it will catch on fast and will be used throughout the world as the universal casing system.  

Case assumptions: 
``_`` assumes private (not to be used publicly often)
``C``(capital) assumes a descriptive function name beginning with a capital

Expections:
``_Capital_Capital`` can be made in languages that are more snakecase based like Rust and Python 
``_Capital_Lowercase`` can also be accepted based on the situation but generally discouraged


Note: ``Capital_Capital`` or``Capital_lowercase``  is HIGHLY discouraged but can be accepted

Rules/What To use:
---------------------------------------
- In the event of a private method with a one word function name, this is encouraged ``_func``

- In the event of a private method with descriptive name, this is encouraged ``_CapitalCapital..``

- In the event of a public method with one word, this is highly encouraged (just the word) ``func``

- In the event of a public method with two words, this is encouraged ``lowercase_lowercase`` (expection: if lowercaseCapital makes more sense, it is encouraged)

- In the event of a class name, this is encouraged ``CapitalCapital``
